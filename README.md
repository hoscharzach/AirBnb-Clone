What this is

This is my full stack AirBnB clone project. Created using node, express, sequelize, react and redux, it has a fully functioning API that you can interact with through the documentation provided in the backend root directory (API_Documentation.md).

You can read, create, update and delete data about all locations, users, reviews, images, and bookings (depending on authorization that is).
