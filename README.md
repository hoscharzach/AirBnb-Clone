# Tarnished BnB

This is my full stack AirBnB clone project. Users can create listings for others to view, book stays at and review. Created using node, express, sequelize, react and redux, it has a fully functioning API that you can interact with through the documentation provided here: [API Documentation](backend/API Documentation.md)

You can read, create, update and delete data about all locations, users, reviews, images, and bookings (depending on authorization that is).

Technologies used:

- SQLite3
- Sequelize
- Postgres
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Node.js
- Express.js
- React
- Redux
- Heroku


## The Landing Page

Here, users can see all of the current listings or click on the profile icon in the top right to sign up or log in. After doing so they can check out their profile or create a listing of their own. Their profile contains a reference to all of their own listings and reviews for quick editing or deleting.

## The more details page
