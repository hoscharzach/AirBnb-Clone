# Tarnished BnB

This is my full stack AirBnB clone project. Users can create listings for others to view, book stays at and review. Created using node, express, sequelize, react and redux, it has a fully functioning API that you can interact with through the documentation provided here: [API Documentation](/backend/API Documentation)

You can read, create, update and delete data about all locations, users, reviews, images, and bookings (depending on authorization that is).

The backend was made with node and express, and the frontend was made using react-redux.

Technologies used:

- SQLite3
- Sequelize
- Postgres
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Node.js
- Express.js
- React
- Redux
- Heroku
