What this is

This is my full stack AirBnB clone project. Created using node, express, sequelize, react and redux, it has a fully functioning API that you can interact with through the documentation provided in the backend root directory (API_Documentation.md).

You can read, create, update and delete data about all locations, users, reviews, images, and bookings (depending on authorization that is).

The backend was made with node and express, and the frontend was made using react-redux.
