# Tarnished BnB

This is my full stack AirBnB clone project. Users can create listings for others to view and leave reviews, as well as book stays at locations, as long as they don't own the location. API documentation can be found in the backend directory.

Technologies used:

- SQLite3
- Sequelize
- Postgres
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Node.js
- Express.js
- React

- Heroku


## Landing Page

Here, users can see all of the current listings or click on the profile icon in the top right to sign up or log in. After doing so they can check out their bookings or create a listing of their own.

## The more details page

Here, users can see all the details about a spot, such as description and how many bosses/bonfires. Users can scroll down to interact with the create booking section or scroll down further to see reviews for the spot.
